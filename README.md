# Food blog

This is my assignment for the Web Application Development module. It is a blog where chefs post recipes and visitors can comment under the posts. In order to develop it I have used:
* **PHP (Laravel)**
* **Blade**
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **VueJS**

## Description :memo:

The web application's features are:
* User accounts for Chefs and Visitors
* Accounts have a name, image, role and posts
* Chefs can create posts
* The posts have title, tags, author, images, nutritional info, description
* The author of the post can edit or delete it
* Each page has a maximum of 10 posts and users can go between pages
* Users can make dynamic comments under a post
* The author of the comment can dynamically edit or delete it
* Users can search for food by tag
* Users can see a list of the chefs
* Bonus API feature: COVID-19 info for the United Kingdom
